      <title>2125: The Two Minds Future</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;2125-the-two-minds-future&#34;&gt;2125: The Two Minds Future&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I occasionally fast-forward to see where AI might go as it grows smarter and can compete with humans in today&amp;rsquo;s tasks. These CEOs and Gen Z business owners frequently claim to work 120–140 hours per week, or at the very least, support it for their staff members (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s possible to work 140 hours per week and maintain mental health). This is especially true outside of Europe, where work-life balance is well-known. In an academic setting, a typical project in my field of study, like building a functional digital twin for an agricultural test field, can take well over two years with teamwork and other administrative duties. This is because our work is frequently limited by human limitations, and AI may help us accomplish these objectives much more quickly. Even with AI, creating a digital twin of an agricultural field could take longer than two years. This isn&amp;rsquo;t because it&amp;rsquo;s technically impossible to complete in two weeks, but rather because, in academia, fewer workers are typically hired for a given task, and these workers also have lives outside of work and many other responsibilities that AI can&amp;rsquo;t replace or help with anytime soon (kids, hobbies, the ups and downs of everyday life).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Academic Journey until 2020</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;welcome-to-my-journey-in-academia&#34;&gt;Welcome to My Journey in Academia&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Programming has been a significant part of my academic life for the past 15 years.&#xA;From simulating the Sun to modeling plants, I&amp;rsquo;ve explored various aspects of the&#xA;world around us through numerical methods. Looking back, it&amp;rsquo;s been a journey filled&#xA;with challenges, discoveries, and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I want to share my programming journey and academic experiences—not as&#xA;a polished narrative, but as a candid recollection of what comes to mind. Right now,&#xA;programming skills are how I earn my bread and butter. Reflecting on where I started,&#xA;what I learned, and the moments where I stumbled, I hope to capture the essence of my path so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
