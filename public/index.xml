      <title>2125: The Two Minds Future</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;2125-the-two-minds-future&#34;&gt;2125: The Two Minds Future&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As AI becomes increasingly intelligent and capable of competing with todays human tasks, I sometimes fast forward to imagine where this trajectory can lead to. I often see these CEOs and Gen Z&#xA;entrepreneurs (especially outside the european countries as europe is renowned for work-life balance) claiming to put in 120-140 hours of work every week or at least advocating it for their employees (I&amp;rsquo;m not certain if it is possible to work 140 hrs a week and stay mentally&#xA;healthy). In an academic environment, a typical work in my area of research such as for example creating a working digital twin for an agricultural test field can take well over two years with collaborations and other administrative tasks, because our work is&#xA;often tied to our human limitations and may be here AI definitely acts as assistant to achieve this goals much faster. Even with AI, building something like a digital twin of an agri field might take more than two years – not because it&amp;rsquo;s technically impossible&#xA;to do it within two weeks, but because usually in academics, less employees are hired for a given task and these employees also have a life outside work and lot of other things to take care of that cannot be&#xA;anytime soon replaced or aided by AI (kids, hobbies, normal life&amp;rsquo;s ups and downs).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;welcome-to-my-journey-in-academia&#34;&gt;Welcome to My Journey in Academia&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Programming has been a significant part of my academic life for the past 15 years.&#xA;From simulating the Sun to modeling plants, I’ve explored various aspects of the&#xA;world around us through numerical methods. Looking back, it’s been a journey filled&#xA;with challenges, discoveries, and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I want to share my programming journey and academic experiences—not as&#xA;a polished narrative, but as a candid recollection of what comes to mind. Right now,&#xA;programming skills are how I earn my bread and butter. Reflecting on where I started,&#xA;what I learned, and the moments where I stumbled, I hope to capture the essence of my path so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
