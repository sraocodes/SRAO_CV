<p>As AI becomes increasingly intelligent and capable of competing with todays human tasks, I sometimes fast forward to imagine where this trajectory can lead to. I often see these CEOs and Gen Z
entrepreneurs (especially outside the european countries as europe is renowned for work-life balance) claiming to put in 120-140 hours of work every week or at least advocating it for their employees (I&rsquo;m not certain if it is possible to work 140 hrs a week and stay mentally
healthy). In an academic environment, a typical work in my area of research such as for example creating a working digital twin for an agricultural test field can take well over two years with collaborations and other administrative tasks, because our work is
often tied to our human limitations and may be here AI definitely acts as assistant to achieve this goals much faster. Even with AI, building something like a digital twin of an agri field might take more than two years – not because it&rsquo;s technically impossible
to do it within two weeks, but because usually in academics, less employees are hired for a given task and these employees also have a life outside work and lot of other things to take care of that cannot be
anytime soon replaced or aided by AI (kids, hobbies, normal life&rsquo;s ups and downs).</p>
<p>Now lets imagine that all 8 billion people are motivated to work those crazy 140 hours - everyone coding, collecting data, building AI systems, driving trains, buses etc. All this human effort, whether
it&rsquo;s physical work generating training data for a physical robot or direct AI or code development, would get fast-forwarded at an incredible pace. The end result? We&rsquo;d probably end up
with superintelligent AI, automated driving systems and armies of robots way sooner than expected. With this super intelligent AI, nobody&rsquo;s will want to sit in front of a computer to
code nor drive a vehicle any more. Even to access this super intelligence we need not sit in front of computer or stare at smartphones.Instead, we&rsquo;ll probably have something way more direct -
a digital twin, or better yet, a second mind, an AI mind that becomes part of us.</p>
<p>Todays Social Media already has both positive and negative impact on people&rsquo;s minds, consuming the collective humanity&rsquo;s time in significant proportions. Now these AI minds would be our smart phone
in 100 years where brain can experience two minds. Its like how devices connect to Wi-Fi, except it&rsquo;s our brains connecting directly to this AI mind. There are already
some progress going on in brain interfaces and artificial general intelligence.
All this progress will naturally merge into a second mind capable of communicating with
our brain. These hypothetical AI minds could also change or evolve our biological minds to deal not only with body and other humans mind but also a second AI mind with
super intelligence of entire humanity.</p>
<p>And with this mind setup, I will be able to switch between my biological mind and AI mind. When I talk to someone, I&rsquo;ll never know if they&rsquo;re using their AI mind
to respond while their real mind is somewhere else. We could even get different versions of AI minds - maybe shopping for ones that come at different prices!
Some of us might have our mind migrated to a robot while our body runs on the AI mind.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is, this AI mind would have access to all knowledge through LLMs and whatever else we develop. Our biological brain
would be constantly learning from the AI mind. No more traditional schools or teachers needed - we&rsquo;re just constantly learning from our own AI mind.
The AI mind would also be learning from how our biological mind development and how it thinks. They&rsquo;d work in perfect sync. Once they&rsquo;re in harmony
like that, you could even move between your biological body and a physical digital twin.</p>
<p>So we would have AI doctors who could fix any &ldquo;mind bugs&rdquo; - like if your AI mind goes offline or you can&rsquo;t connect to it properly. The AI mind would always be monitoring
your body&rsquo;s vitals, so detailed it could spot cancer when it&rsquo;s just 100 cells. It&rsquo;s kind of like those yogis or enlightened people who say they can sense each organ working
through chakra activation - except this would be the technological version. These are the some of the possibilities we&rsquo;d have!</p>
<p>There was this Johnny Depp&rsquo;s movie I watched back in 2014 while doing my master&rsquo;s at Alabama - Transcendence, it was a flop movie though.
Like in that movie, maybe everyone will get a mind that never dies in 2125. I think in 100 years, we won&rsquo;t have the same problems they had in that movie from 2014. I mean,
I didn&rsquo;t get inspired by this movie for this blog, but as I&rsquo;m writing this, it just popped into my mind? It was actually one of the movies I really enjoyed back then.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say we have this technology working perfectly, not sinister like in the movie. Everything&rsquo;s good, I&rsquo;m sitting there with this AI mind (not just me, erery one,
this mind is 2125&rsquo;s chatGPT), robots making my coffee and everything (if I survive to see that day, I wont). But then what? What&rsquo;s the purpose? Maybe I&rsquo;d end up enjoying
just doing physical work, farming, or watering plants. You know, enjoying nature, sunshine, rain - we&rsquo;d be going in one full circle! That&rsquo;s exactly what people used to do
before industrial revolution. Maybe we created all this complexity, and now AI takes that complexity away. But there&rsquo;s this enormous risk - what if it doesn&rsquo;t work as intended? I mean, it&rsquo;s one thing if someone
hacks your laptop, but what if they hack your mind? That&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>But even if everything goes perfectly utopian, what&rsquo;s the human relevance then? Sure, we&rsquo;ll have spiritual values, physical work, enjoying nature - all this existed before
modern technology anyway. Maybe ultimate technology will remove human suffering like diseases and stuff. But for healthy people? They might just go back full circle. Though
for people with challenges, like those without legs or vision, this technology would be amazing! I&rsquo;m just thinking from a normal, healthy person&rsquo;s perspective -
maybe we&rsquo;ll end up enjoying the simple things again. Who knows, maybe someday coding on a laptop will feel as outdated as enjoying a day at the beach.</p>
<p>Here we are in 2025 with AI that can tap into all human knowledge through a chat window affecting trillion worth economy. By 2125, we might each have our own digital
twin, just endless conversations with our AI digital twin. What kind of economic system&rsquo;s will handle that? What currency will we even use? Sure, we can see where the
science is headed, but if it moves too fast, we could end up somewhere pretty dangerous. As we push forward, we&rsquo;ve got to think about what all this means for everyone.
Maybe it&rsquo;s all about finding that sweet spot - not too much, not too little.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;ve got nuclear plants powering all these digital twins, and robots doing all the physical work, what are we 8 billion humans even here
for? We&rsquo;re using all our energy right now to build this perfect AI world, but once it&rsquo;s done&hellip; then what? Maybe we&rsquo;ll end up right back where we started, but with this
crazy advanced tech running in the background. It&rsquo;s interesting to think about, right? So I will end here this blog.</p>

                            <h3 id="welcome-to-my-journey-in-academia">Welcome to My Journey in Academia</h3>
<p>Programming has been a significant part of my academic life for the past 15 years.
From simulating the Sun to modeling plants, I’ve explored various aspects of the
world around us through numerical methods. Looking back, it’s been a journey filled
with challenges, discoveries, and growth.</p>
<p>In this blog, I want to share my programming journey and academic experiences—not as
a polished narrative, but as a candid recollection of what comes to mind. Right now,
programming skills are how I earn my bread and butter. Reflecting on where I started,
what I learned, and the moments where I stumbled, I hope to capture the essence of my path so far.</p>
<p>This is my first blog post on my website, and it’s more about revisiting the
milestones that brought me here. I’ll write, reflect, and edit iteratively as
I go—just like coding, where nothing is perfect on the first run.</p>
<h3 id="2006--2010">2006- 2010</h3>
<p>My programming journey began with the very first program I wrote in 2006. After that over the past 15 years,
I’ve spent most of my time programming and simulating different things that make up  a part of this world
using some numerical methods. But after all this time and
work, If I try to recall my earliest days in coding, only bits and pieces come back to me. We can’t remember everything,
can we? What I do remember of my academic and programming journey, I wanted to share here in my very first blog on my website.</p>
<p>During my bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication engineering <strong>(around 2007 to 2010)</strong>
at BMSIT, Bengaluru, I remember writing sorting algorithms in C++ and working on microcontroller
programming in assembly language. I was working with MATLAB, where I only remember implementing
high-pass, low-pass, and band-pass filters. These stand out as strong memories, even though there
were countless other programming exercises (maybe I have a weak memory) across various subjects.</p>
<p>So, don’t think I was very interested in programming. During this time, I actually thought
programming was an technically inferior as compared to designing physical circuits, antennas,
or other electronic devices. But eventually, it became a part of my career. Till now, I have
survived with it. And so, I will share more of my stories, like my master’s and PhD, down the line.
But I just wanted to clarify that I was not at all passionate about programming in the beginning,
and I don’t even claim that I’ve achieved something big, like inventing a new programming language.
What I am trying to say is, right now, I can comfortably earn my bread and butter with programming.
That’s why I thought of writing this blog.</p>
<h3 id="my-masters-saga-in-usa-2010-2014">My Masters Saga in USA (2010-2014)</h3>
<p>So, it was in 2010 when I finished my bachelor’s degree. I wanted was to pursue higher studies in
an international environment. And of course, the obvious choice—even now—is the United States. It attracts a lot of people,
and during my time, I also went to the United States to do my master’s degree. In 2010, I joined
the University of Alabama in Huntsville to study electrical engineering.</p>
<p>Back then, the fees were high for a lower middle-class Indian family, just like they are today. To make
it work, my parents had to part with almost 50% of their life savings. So, once I got to the U.S.,
I had to figure out ways to save or make money while studying. One obvious way was to get a graduate
research assistantship or a teaching assistantship.</p>
<p>However, coming from India with poor English language skills, it was tough. My GRE verbal score
wasn’t that impressive (330/800), though I scored very high in quantitative (780/800)—90th percentile,
which means I did better than 90% of the test-takers. But even with that, my weak English made it harder
to secure a teaching assistantship.</p>
<p>In those days, we didn&rsquo;t have ChatGPT or Deepseek to help us improve our English, like the way it&rsquo;s helping
me write this blog now in 2025. So, my options were limited. I didn&rsquo;t have the privilege or luck in this life
of attending elite research universities like Stanford or MIT, where students pursuing their research could
study on scholarships and explore topics on their own, and these places had large endowments to support such
independent activity. But outside these places, there were few options for me. I had to fit into a project
that had funding, whether it interested me or not, as it was a great deal if I could save a lot of money by
helping a professor (which means less burden on my poor parents, who, being from a less capitalistically savvy generation,
believed that a degree alone would lead to a stable future) finish their project and I could also learn a few things.
But for me, learning science has always been the same. After working in many areas, I barely notice any boundary between
disciplines. Whether I’m dealing with Darcy’s law or Ohm’s law, my satisfaction as a numerical scientist doesn’t change.</p>
<p>So coming back to my Masters degree, opportunities were scarce, and only a few professors had funding. I ended up choosing Late
Prof. Nagendra Singh as my Master&rsquo;s thesis adviser, who was working in computational plasma physics employing methods like particle
in cell and Magnetohydrodynamics (a kind of CFD), even though it was very new to me. Prior to this, I had no idea what plasma was,
except in my high school I heard it as 4th state of matter and that it was present in the Sun.</p>
<p>I took on a thesis under him because it offered a graduate research assistantship that reduced my fees and expenses. This was
the first time I was pushed into the world of computing and modeling because my job required me to learn Linux, supercomputing,
and other tools. And so, out of necessity—to save money and complete my master&rsquo;s degree—I was introduced to supercomputing and
PHYSICS.</p>
<p>This was the first time I encountered Linux, which, surprisingly, wasn&rsquo;t part of my undergraduate curriculum in India. It seems
Linux is only taught in computer science programs, but I feel it should be introduced across all branches of engineering.
Back then, around 2010-2011, Stack Overflow and online forums were my online gurus. Google was like the GPT of that era for me.
Those were the days I learned about command-line interfaces, running jobs on supercomputing clusters, and the concept of software
licenses.</p>
<p>Until then, I had taken software like MATLAB for granted. In my undergraduate days, I used it on university computers without
considering who paid for it. But during my master&rsquo;s, when I needed it for home assignments, I discovered that I needed to pay
for a student edition and a company called Mathworks makes this software. You know, I have been ignorant unlike today&rsquo;s GenZ.
I grew up with floppy drives and now I&rsquo;m living with Thunderbolt 5. So we can&rsquo;t compare with today.</p>
<p>I also had to learn about parallel computing, learning about MPI and OpenMPI for messy Fortran codes. Python wasn&rsquo;t as
mainstream as it is today, so I worked primarily with MATLAB and Fortran.</p>
<p>So, let me also share what exactly was my work during my master’s degree. There was this 2,000-line Fortran code
my professor gave me, and honestly, it was the first time I realized that a code could even exceed 2,000 lines!
Back in my bachelor’s, whether it was a band-pass filter or a Fourier transform, most of our lab exercises were
50 lines of code at most. This was on a completely different level.</p>
<p>The task was to modify this massive code because it didn’t compute the magnetic field of a Helmholtz coil.
My professor asked me to write a function for that, solve it numerically using the Biot-Savart law, integrate it,
and then parallelize it using MPI. The goal was to model how plasma flows in an experimental device and compare the
results with actual experiments conducted at the Australian National University.</p>
<p>First, I wrote a code to solve the Biot-Savart law. It wasn’t overly complex, but handling it in 3D added its own challenges.
Then, I integrated this new functionality into the existing Fortran code, ensuring that the variables and logic aligned perfectly.
It was like adding a new feature to a large, unfamiliar system. Somehow, I managed to finish this work in six months.
Looking back, I wonder if it was the energy of youth or sheer necessity that pushed me through. It wasn’t easy, but it
resulted in two publications.</p>
<p>If you ask me now whether this work made a significant impact, I’d say probably not. I feel that even if I had taken
a non-thesis option or chosen a different field, it wouldn’t have mattered much in the long run. But at that time,
getting published felt like winning a Nobel Prize. Seeing my name on a paper gave me immense pride. Those publications,
which you’ll still find on my CV, form the basis of my contributions to the physics of plasma.</p>
<p>While working on this project, I developed a deep love for physics. It felt almost spiritual to me, and I began
regretting my decision to pursue engineering instead of physics. This newfound passion drove me to apply for a PhD in physics.
However, switching to a good university wasn’t easy. Navigating the application process in a foreign country was unclear to me,
and I didn’t have strong recommendations.</p>
<p>In the same town, there was another university—a historically black university with many Indian faculty members.
To satisfy my love for physics, I joined their PhD program. But the work there felt far from what I imagined physics
would be. It mostly involved lab experiments, like working with biophysics and optics, which didn’t eventually align with
my interests. I was handling polymer molecules, thin membranes, and chemicals like polybutadiene ( i dont remember),
often without proper safety measures. All I remember is there was no gas masks and the moment I used this chemical
there were pins and needles in my skin as I inhaled this, and I felt more like a lab assistant handling chemicals rather
than a physicist.</p>
<p>I had this romanticized idea that studying physics would take me back to the times of Newton or Gauss. I know I was wrong
now but not back then. My physics experience, at least in the PhD program I was in, felt mundane and uninspiring. After
spending one and a half years there, I decided not to waste more time. I converted my PhD into a master’s degree and returned
to India.I came back with no solid plan, but the thought of pursuing a PhD still remained in me.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-landed-up-first-time-in-germany-in-2015">How I landed up first time in Germany in 2015?</h3>
<p>In 2014, after leaving my PhD program, I returned to India and faced my first real spell of unemployment. That period was a
challenge. I spent time earning course era and other certificates, enhancing my LinkedIn profile, and trying to build visibility
through platforms like MATLAB File Exchange as well as applying PhD positions world wide including IISc Bengaluru. I have attempted
3 times to get into IISc PhD programs after having 3 publications and two masters degree in USA, but I was rejected everytime.
The only reason I was interested in IISc is because of its location in Bengaluru which is my home town.</p>
<p>I eventually received two PhD opportunity in 2015, one in South Korea on windmill simulation and other at the University of Paderborn
in Germany in theoretical physics in the year 2015. I was also fascinated by the idea of studying in Europe. Many of the great
physicists I admired were from European institutions, and Germany especially stood out to me.</p>
<p>I should also explain why I liked Germany - I think it&rsquo;s a great country to study and also very practical. If I look back at
my experience with degrees from the US or other countries, they all required things like letters of recommendation, medical
tests, and other formalities. I&rsquo;m originally from India, and getting a US visa itself was a struggle. I received a pink slip
(221g) [I still remember somethings!] during the process, and it wasn&rsquo;t easy at all. On top of that, the fees for studying in
the US were extremely high.</p>
<p>When I went to Belgium for my PhD, they required a medical test to ensure I was disease-free before I could even begin.
Although I did complete my PhD in Belgium, the visa process wasn&rsquo;t as easy as it was with Germany. I also have experience
getting visas from Gulf countries, and they too require medical tests just like Belgium. Though I did not have any disease,
I like that Germany doesn&rsquo;t care about foreigners&rsquo; prior health status when issuing visas.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t ask me for letters of recommendation or if I had any disease for the visa. They liked my profile based on my
interview and gave me admission to their PhD program in Theoretical Physics at Paderborn, to which I&rsquo;m still grateful.
This was in the year 2015. It was in quantum physics, which fascinated me, but the level of background knowledge required
was far beyond what I had. I didn&rsquo;t have a strong foundation in theoretical physics, and after one year, I had to quit the
program. Unfortunately, by then, I had become somewhat of an expert in quitting PhD programs.</p>
<p>I did consider doing a PhD in India and even applied to some programs, including IISc, but I wasn’t successful. I’ll save
that experience for another blog, so don’t assume I ruled out India as an option. However, at that time, I found the
application process and overall system of European universities to be much more straightforward and practical.
Interestingly, IISc itself was historically modeled after Western universities (British, American and German influence),
so in many ways, choosing a European institution wasn’t a drastic shift — it was just a path that worked
out better for me.</p>
<p>So coming back to my journey, leaving the PhD program at Paderborn was yet another learning experience. While in Germany,
I picked up a few things—including Bitte and Danke—but I also had to accept my limitations in theoretical physics. Still,
I was determined to complete a PhD and kept looking for opportunities.</p>
<p>That’s when I came across an opening at the University of Louvain in Belgium for a project on modeling the electrical
signatures of plant roots. The topic intrigued me because it involved modeling, which I enjoyed, and plants, which had
always fascinated me. At first, I thought, “What does the electrical signature of plants even mean?” But the idea was
compelling enough for me to apply.</p>
<p>To my surprise, I received an offer in 2016—but not without challenges. One of the key requirements was a recommendation
letter, and securing that wasn&rsquo;t straightforward since I had quit my previous projects and failed to impress those
supervisors! Let me explain!</p>
<h3 id="my-struggles-with-letters-of-recommendations">My Struggles with Letters of recommendations</h3>
<p>At that time, I reached out to professors from the two universities where I had completed my master’s degrees in the US. Getting recommendation letters proved challenging. In the second university—where I’d briefly joined a PhD program as a lab assistant before leaving—I sensed my departure hadn’t gone over well, so I felt uneasy asking for a letter. Still, I tried, but got no response. Sometimes, people focus on their own commitments and may not feel motivated to help once you’ve moved on.</p>
<p>At the first master’s university, where I had a stellar publication record, my main advisor for the plasma physics thesis had unfortunately passed away—he was already in his 70s when I worked with him. I hadn’t really networked with other professors there, so I had no one else to ask.</p>
<p>All of this made me question why many universities still insist on multiple recommendation letters. It seems outdated—like they’re just filtering applications rather than really getting to know the candidate. An experienced professor or committee could rely on interviews and a candidate’s portfolio of work, right? I find it frustrating that recommendation letters can sometimes be leveraged unfairly if a student isn’t on perfect terms with their supervisors.</p>
<p>That said, there are definitely good people out there who write <strong>excellent</strong> letters when you need them. For instance, professors at the University of Paderborn in Germany were remarkably supportive. Even though I didn’t initially ask them for a recommendation—having left that PhD program as well—they still vouched for me for the Belgian PhD position. Without their support, I might not have completed a PhD at all. Those letters helped me secure my fellowship in Belgium, and my PhD adviser there even mentioned how positive my Paderborn supervisor’s recommendation had been!</p>
<h3 id="my-phd-2016-to-2020-in-belgium">My PhD (2016 to 2020) in Belgium</h3>
<p>So, I got my Belgian visa and began my PhD at the <strong>University of Louvain</strong>. If you ask me what stands out from those years of research,
it’s this: I learned how to create finite element meshes for very complicated geometry. Before my PhD, I was proficient in the finite
difference method, but finite element methods were new territory for me.</p>
<p>In my earlier experiences—whether during my master’s or at the University of Paderborn in theoretical physics—coding always
involved starting from scratch. I had to write everything myself. But during my PhD, I learned how to utilize ready-made software
models developed from years of multiple PhD projects like EIDORS (tomography in MATLAB) or R-SWMS ( plant modelling tool in Fortran).
Whether it was for electrical resistivity tomography (EIDORS) or simulating plant roots (R-SWMS), the challenge was to use these tools
in a synchronized way to solve my specific problem.</p>
<p>The specific problem I worked on during my PhD wasn’t something I defined myself. My professors had proposed the problem, secured
funding for it, and I accepted the offer to work on it. The project was focused on quantifying the electrical signature of plant
roots.</p>
<p>In a way, this is how the academic system works at least in Europe—it’s very structured. A project exists, funding is secured,
and researchers are brought in to help solve the problem and complete the project. That’s how most PhDs work in Europe. Unlike in
places like IITs or IISc in India or some elite rich universities like Yale or Harvard, where students often spend the first couple
of years figuring out what they want to do, the PhD structure in Europe is more defined from the start.</p>
<p>The PhD problem was well-defined, which meant I could focus my energy on solving it without wandering aimlessly. Having such a
structured PhD also gave me time to pursue other interests. For example, during my PhD, I finally learned to play the violin—something
I had wanted to do for years but never had the time to even buy one. I wouldn’t call myself an expert now either, but I learned for
about a year. At least in this lifetime, I had the chance to play a violin, and that was possible because my PhD project saved me time
by being so focused.</p>
<p>In my opinion, professors are experienced enough to propose meaningful problems, and if they believe a problem is worth solving, it
likely is. Our role, then, is to contribute to solving that problem, finish the project, and earn the degree. This doesn’t mean you
lack independence in a well-defined project. These projects often operate within a larger framework, giving you the freedom to explore
related ideas.</p>
<p>For instance, within my PhD’s broader framework of quantifying the electrical signature of roots, I worked on a smaller project to
show that electrical anisotropy could be used as a root phenotyping parameter. While this idea was presented at conferences, it never got published. But that didn’t matter much to me at the time because it was an opportunity to explore something new within the boundaries of the larger project.</p>
<p>It’s a misconception that well-defined projects restrict creativity. In fact, I believe they’re better because they save time and
allow for focused progress. When I look back now, at 35 as I am writing this blog, I truly understand the value of time. Anything
that helps save time should be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Now coming back to the PhD work, If I had to pick my most significant contribution during my PhD, it would be developing
finite element meshes in 3D for complex plant root systems. This was no small feat and was appreciated by my peers. Apart from
that, my PhD work led to two first-author publications, with 80% of the paper writing being my own contribution, and the rest
polished by my thesis supervisor.</p>
<p>This felt different from my master’s degree, where I also had three publications (two as the first author and one as the second).
However, during my master’s, my writing was significantly revised by my thesis supervisor—more than 50% of it. Back then, I might
have been generating results and figures, but I wasn’t structuring the papers myself. It felt like I was a precursor to ChatGPT
for my advisor, where I provided inputs, and they assembled the work into a coherent paper.</p>
<p>This experience gave me a broader perspective on the “number game” in academia. While some places, like in developing world, still
value publication numbers above all else, I believe it’s the quality and originality of the contribution that matter more. But
that’s a discussion for another blog.</p>
<p>Returning to my PhD, I worked extensively on simulating plant root water uptake. One of my tasks involved adapting a finite
element software originally designed for medical imaging of heart and lung systems. This tool, developed in the UK, was repurposed
for our experiments with maize root systems in a risotron setup. Creating finite element meshes for these complex geometries was
challenging but rewarding.</p>
<p>Once I completed meshing a single root system, I scaled up my work. I automated tasks to simulate thousands of plants and their
interactions. Automation was a significant skill I developed during my PhD. Before this, I would run one software, manually plot
each result, and feel content. But during my PhD, I had to scale up these processes. By my fourth year, a single plant simulation
that used to feel monumental had become just a DOT in a scatterplot of thousands of simulations.</p>
<p>This was also the time—around 2018—when I was introduced to Python. Although Python had been around for a while, it was new to me.
I quickly grew fond of it and transitioned away from my old buddy MATLAB. From then on, Python became my primary tool for simulations
and data processing.</p>
<p>In 2020, I defended my PhD thesis. This was during the COVID-19 pandemic, a time that brought its own set of challenges.
When I defended my PhD in October 2020, the world had changed—it was the time of COVID. It was the first time I experienced
lockdowns, restrictions, and the chaos of a pandemic. People were dying everywhere, and the world felt like a war zone.
Somehow, I managed to finish my PhD and return to India during this turbulent time. Looking back, it was surreal,
almost like living through a world war. But we made it through, and life moved on.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>I think I’ll end this blog here. If there’s anything to take away from my journey, here’s what I’d advise:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Changing paths is okay but make sure time is not wasted</strong>. I started in electronics, ventured into plasma physics, attempted theoretical physics, and
finally finished my PhD in a mix of electrical engineering and plant modelling. Your first choice doesn&rsquo;t have to be your final
destination. I have a broad experience now to have confidence to work in any new discipline with ease but at the cost of few years of wastage.</li>
<li><strong>University rankings aren&rsquo;t everything.</strong> While I was once obsessed with university rankings, I&rsquo;ve learned that what matters more
is finding the right fit for your goals and circumstances. Some of my most valuable experiences came from unexpected places.
For example, it was only after completing my PhD, during the COVID time when I was unemployed, that I learned about the existence
of the stock market and the massive financial world it represents. I discovered that there are companies like BlackRock or Morgan
Stanley handling trillions of dollars in transactions. It was eye-opening to realize how much of the world operates through these
financial systems—something I had never thought about when I was employed. So tomorrow if I invent a algorithm to crack stock market, I will owe
to this period of unemployment.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to think Algorithmically</strong>, regardless of your field. Even though I initially thought programming was technically inferior to hardware design,
it became my bread and butter. Being adaptable with technology opens doors. Even now I see how difficult it is to find a job without
this skill. Though we have LLM&rsquo;s now, it would take atleast a decade to turn coding skills into floppy disk.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace structured opportunities</strong>. While the romantic notion of complete academic freedom is appealing, well-defined projects
(like my Belgian PhD) can actually provide focus while still allowing room for creativity and side interests.</li>
<li><strong>Build relationships</strong> respectfully. The professors at Paderborn provided recommendations even after I left their program,
which proved important for my future. How you leave matters as much as how you start.</li>
<li><strong>Time is precious.</strong> Looking back at 35, I now realize the immense value of time more than ever. Choosing structured
programs and opportunities that respect your time while allowing you to grow both professionally and personally is crucial.
Reflecting on my own journey—the struggles for letters of recommendation, quitting programs, or choosing the wrong paths—I see
how one wrong move can lead to years of precious time wastage.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, just because I loved physics, I thought pursuing it academically would fulfill me. In hindsight, I could have simply
watched MIT OpenCourseWare lectures or listened to great physicists like Michio Kaku for inspiration. Those are wonderful, but
at the end of the day, we have to be practical. If PhD degree was my goal, I should have chosen structured program in Europe
right after my first Master&rsquo;s degree! One wrong decision can lead to wasted years and a difficult experience.</p>
<p>Now, some people might argue that research should stem purely from passion and interest, and that doing a PhD should be about a
deep love for discovery. But in the era of ChatGPT, I feel research is essentially about critical thinking and solving problems.
That’s all it is.</p>
<p>I don’t see much difference between the work I do in academia and the work people do in the industry. Both fields are
about addressing pressing issues. We’re not necessarily discovering brand-new things—most foundational discoveries have
already been made. We are, as they say, <strong>standing on the shoulders of giants.</strong></p>
<p>Take, for instance, the discovery of the exponential number  e . Jacob Bernoulli didn’t find it only out of pure curiosity—he
was solving a financial problem related to compound interest. Similarly, Fourier series was developed by Joseph Fourier
not just as a romantic pursuit of mathematics, but to address practical challenges during the Industrial Revolution, such
as analyzing periodic heat flow in steam engines. In fact industrial revolution few centuries back made West dominant
in science and technology.</p>
<p>Great scientific breakthroughs didn’t come from just loving science; they emerged from solving real-world problems.
Science wasn’t—and isn’t—a romantic affair; it’s a practical endeavor that I learnt the hard way. Of course, I could be
wrong—this is just my opinion. But I believe it’s worth reflecting on how much of what we do, whether in academia or industry,
is rooted in solving practical challenges, just as it always has been.</p>
<p>Now, I understand that time is <strong>irreplaceable</strong>. Every moment should serve a purpose: it should either generate value for
the future, enhance your profile, improve your mental or physical health, or bring genuine fulfillment. Time is finite, and
how we spend it matters greatly—whether that’s working, learning, or simply resting.</p>
<p>It may feel late to realize this, but as they say, <strong>“better late than never.”</strong> From now on, I’ve committed to being intentional
with my time, and I hope you will too. <strong>Respect your time—it’s the most valuable resource you have.</strong>
<span style="color: red;">Respect others time!</span> <strong>AVOID people who do not respect your TIME</strong> <span style="color: blue;"> Remember,
these reflections come from my personal journey - yours might be different.</span></p>
