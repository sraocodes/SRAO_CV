                <h3 id="the-two-minds-future">The Two Minds Future</h3>
<p>As AI becomes increasingly intelligent, I often find myself fast-forwarding to imagine where this trajectory would leads us. We see CEOs and Gen Z bigballs putting in 120-140 hours per week, pushing the boundaries of what&rsquo;s achievable. In my own work on digital twins for agricultural fields, I&rsquo;ve noticed how the pace of progress is tied to our human limitations. In a typical academic setting from a postdoc perspective, certain developments such as a digital twin of a agri field might take more than a year – not because they&rsquo;re technically impossible, but because we have lives apart from work, families, children, hobbies, and other aspects that make us one of the living organism on earth made by nature or grand universal order.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine we achieve this super-advanced AI, where everyone gets their own digital twin. But what if we pushed past these limitations? What if everyone (8 billion people) worked those 120+ hours, All this crazy work just to end up with&hellip; a second mind to deal with! It&rsquo;s like buying a second car when you can&rsquo;t even park the first one properly.! Now we have two minds to worry about – our original biological one and a new AI mind. With advanced brain interfaces, we&rsquo;ll feel the presence of both in a seemless way.</p>
<p>Right now social media and Facebook already affect some aspect of people&rsquo;s mind who use them, but at least people can put down the phone or close the laptop. But if we have a digital twin in 100 years, it&rsquo;s like 100% connected to us. It can totally affect the biological mind and society in ways we can&rsquo;t even imagine (both negative and positive).</p>
<p>And with this mind, you will have an ability to switch between biological mind and the AI mind. So if you become an AI mind, all your limitations - like being socially awkward or anything - they&rsquo;re just gone. But at the same time, it&rsquo;s kind of a messy situation. I don&rsquo;t know how things are going to work out. Maybe there will be policies - some people will choose not to have this mind, some people will choose to have it. And we won&rsquo;t even be able to tell if someone is operating from their AI mind or their biological mind!</p>
<p>The irony is that while we expect AI to free us from work, we might actually be coming full circle. In the pre-digital era, true freedom was experienced through physical labor and direct engagement with the world—working on farmland, crafting ideas with paper and pen. Great minds like Euler and Laplace made groundbreaking discoveries purely through thought and observation. Now, as AI increasingly takes over computer-based tasks—and may soon replace nearly all digital work—we could find that only physical work remains inherently human or maybe not with robots. Looking even further ahead, in a century, roles traditionally filled by human interaction—such as psychological therapy or spiritual guidance—might also be supplanted by our digital twins. This progression hints at an unsettling future: one where a second, AI-driven mind or a digital twin of a individual could further individualize us, potentially isolating our innate human connections even as technology advances.</p>
<p>Here we are in 2025, with AI that can access all human knowledge through a chat interface. By 2125, we might each have our own digital twin, leading to endless conversations with ourselves. What kind of economic system will support this reality? What currency will we use? T
The path of scientific progress seems clear, but if it becomes too disruptive, we risk heading down a dangerous path. As we advance, we must consider what these changes mean for society as a whole. Perhaps the key lies in finding balance.</p>
