                <h3 id="2125-the-two-minds-future">2125: The Two Minds Future</h3>
<p>As AI becomes increasingly intelligent and capable of competing with todays human tasks, I sometimes fast forward to imagine where this trajectory can lead to. I often see these CEOs and Gen Z
entrepreneurs (especially outside the european countries as europe is renowned for work-life balance) claiming to put in 120-140 hours of work every week or at least advocating it for their employees (I&rsquo;m not certain if it is possible to work 140 hrs a week and stay mentally
healthy). In an academic environment, a typical work in my area of research such as for example creating a working digital twin for an agricultural test field can take well over two years with collaborations and other administrative tasks, because our work is
often tied to our human limitations and may be here AI definitely acts as assistant to achieve this goals much faster. Even with AI, building something like a digital twin of an agri field might take more than two years – not because it&rsquo;s technically impossible
to do it within two weeks, but because usually in academics, less employees are hired for a given task and these employees also have a life outside work and lot of other things to take care of that cannot be
anytime soon replaced or aided by AI (kids, hobbies, normal life&rsquo;s ups and downs).</p>
<p>Now lets imagine that all 8 billion people are motivated to work those crazy 140 hours - everyone coding, collecting data, building AI systems, driving trains, buses etc. All this human effort, whether
it&rsquo;s physical work generating training data for a physical robot or direct AI or code development, would get fast-forwarded at an incredible pace. The end result? We&rsquo;d probably end up
with superintelligent AI, automated driving systems and armies of robots way sooner than expected. With this super intelligent AI, nobody&rsquo;s will want to sit in front of a computer to
code nor drive a vehicle any more. Even to access this super intelligence we need not sit in front of computer or stare at smartphones.Instead, we&rsquo;ll probably have something way more direct -
a digital twin, or better yet, a second mind, an AI mind that becomes part of us.</p>
<p>Todays Social Media already has both positive and negative impact on people&rsquo;s minds, consuming the collective humanity&rsquo;s time in significant proportions. Now these AI minds would be our smart phone
in 100 years where brain can experience two minds. Its like how devices connect to Wi-Fi, except it&rsquo;s our brains connecting directly to this AI mind. There are already
some progress going on in brain interfaces and artificial general intelligence.
All this progress will naturally merge into a second mind capable of communicating with
our brain. These hypothetical AI minds could also change or evolve our biological minds to deal not only with body and other humans mind but also a second AI mind with
super intelligence of entire humanity.</p>
<p>And with this mind setup, I will be able to switch between my biological mind and AI mind. When I talk to someone, I&rsquo;ll never know if they&rsquo;re using their AI mind
to respond while their real mind is somewhere else. We could even get different versions of AI minds - maybe shopping for ones that come at different prices!
Some of us might have our mind migrated to a robot while our body runs on the AI mind.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is, this AI mind would have access to all knowledge through LLMs and whatever else we develop. Our biological brain
would be constantly learning from the AI mind. No more traditional schools or teachers needed - we&rsquo;re just constantly learning from our own AI mind.
The AI mind would also be learning from how our biological mind development and how it thinks. They&rsquo;d work in perfect sync. Once they&rsquo;re in harmony
like that, you could even move between your biological body and a physical digital twin.</p>
<p>So we would have AI doctors who could fix any &ldquo;mind bugs&rdquo; - like if your AI mind goes offline or you can&rsquo;t connect to it properly. The AI mind would always be monitoring
your body&rsquo;s vitals, so detailed it could spot cancer when it&rsquo;s just 100 cells. It&rsquo;s kind of like those yogis or enlightened people who say they can sense each organ working
through chakra activation - except this would be the technological version. These are the some of the possibilities we&rsquo;d have!</p>
<p>There was this Johnny Depp&rsquo;s movie I watched back in 2014 while doing my master&rsquo;s at Alabama - Transcendence, it was a flop movie though.
Like in that movie, maybe everyone will get a mind that never dies in 2125. I think in 100 years, we won&rsquo;t have the same problems they had in that movie from 2014. I mean,
I didn&rsquo;t get inspired by this movie for this blog, but as I&rsquo;m writing this, it just popped into my mind? It was actually one of the movies I really enjoyed back then.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say we have this technology working perfectly, not sinister like in the movie. Everything&rsquo;s good, I&rsquo;m sitting there with this AI mind (not just me, erery one,
this mind is 2125&rsquo;s chatGPT), robots making my coffee and everything (if I survive to see that day, I wont). But then what? What&rsquo;s the purpose? Maybe I&rsquo;d end up enjoying
just doing physical work, farming, or watering plants. You know, enjoying nature, sunshine, rain - we&rsquo;d be going in one full circle! That&rsquo;s exactly what people used to do
before industrial revolution. Maybe we created all this complexity, and now AI takes that complexity away. But there&rsquo;s this enormous risk - what if it doesn&rsquo;t work as intended? I mean, it&rsquo;s one thing if someone
hacks your laptop, but what if they hack your mind? That&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>But even if everything goes perfectly utopian, what&rsquo;s the human relevance then? Sure, we&rsquo;ll have spiritual values, physical work, enjoying nature - all this existed before
modern technology anyway. Maybe ultimate technology will remove human suffering like diseases and stuff. But for healthy people? They might just go back full circle. Though
for people with challenges, like those without legs or vision, this technology would be amazing! I&rsquo;m just thinking from a normal, healthy person&rsquo;s perspective -
maybe we&rsquo;ll end up enjoying the simple things again. Who knows, maybe someday coding on a laptop will feel as outdated as enjoying a day at the beach.</p>
<p>Here we are in 2025 with AI that can tap into all human knowledge through a chat window affecting trillion worth economy. By 2125, we might each have our own digital
twin, just endless conversations with our AI digital twin. What kind of economic system&rsquo;s will handle that? What currency will we even use? Sure, we can see where the
science is headed, but if it moves too fast, we could end up somewhere pretty dangerous. As we push forward, we&rsquo;ve got to think about what all this means for everyone.
Maybe it&rsquo;s all about finding that sweet spot - not too much, not too little.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;ve got nuclear plants powering all these digital twins, and robots doing all the physical work, what are we 8 billion humans even here
for? We&rsquo;re using all our energy right now to build this perfect AI world, but once it&rsquo;s done&hellip; then what? Maybe we&rsquo;ll end up right back where we started, but with this
crazy advanced tech running in the background. It&rsquo;s interesting to think about, right? So I will end here this blog.</p>
