                <h3 id="the-two-minds-future">The Two Minds Future</h3>
<p>As AI becomes increasingly intelligent, I often find myself fast-forwarding to imagine where this trajectory leads us. We see CEOs and Gen Z workers putting in 120-140 hours per week, pushing the boundaries of what&rsquo;s achievable. In my own work on digital twins for agricultural fields, I&rsquo;ve noticed how the pace of progress is tied to our human limitations. In a typical academic setting, certain developments might take a year – not because they&rsquo;re technically impossible, but because we have lives, families, children, hobbies, and other aspects that make us human.</p>
<p>But what if we pushed past these limitations? What if everyone worked those 120+ hours, behaving more like machines? What would be the end result of this accelerated progress?
I&rsquo;ve been questioning this deeply. Let&rsquo;s imagine we achieve this super-advanced artificial intelligence, where everyone has their own digital twin. I would essentially have a second mind – my biological one that I was born with, and an AI mind. With advanced brain interfaces, I might feel the presence of both minds, engaged in constant conversation with each other.
This makes me wonder: are we considering the broader societal implications of such rapid progress? Take autonomous driving – what happens to drivers in the next 100 years? Or consider education – would we need universities if everyone has a digital twin containing all collective human knowledge?</p>
<p>Sure, training our biological minds might still be enjoyable if we&rsquo;re passionate about something. But there&rsquo;s something potentially manipulative about this future. Imagine it&rsquo;s 2125, and everyone has their digital twin. You&rsquo;d be simultaneously master and apprentice – guru and shishya – to your own digital self. How would daily life unfold? Would we spend our days conversing with our digital twins? Would we still need to meet fellow humans?</p>
<p>Yes, this technological progress could cure cancer and other diseases. But I&rsquo;m concerned about those who advocate for these extreme work hours. If we&rsquo;re truly concerned about curing diseases, shouldn&rsquo;t we also focus on preventing them? A healthy lifestyle, exercise, and hobbies are crucial in disease prevention. Our current sedentary lifestyle – sitting in front of computers for 8+ hours daily – might itself be causing unknown health issues. This isn&rsquo;t our natural state.
The irony is that while we think AI will free us from work, we might be coming full circle. Before technology, weren&rsquo;t we already free in a different way? Working on farmland, engaging in physical labor, using paper and pen? Think about Euler, Laplace, and other great scientists who made groundbreaking discoveries without computers – they discovered concepts like the exponential number through pure thought and observation.</p>
<p>Here we are in 2025, with AI that can access all human knowledge through a chat interface. By 2125, we might each have our own digital twin, leading to endless conversations with ourselves. What kind of economic system will support this reality? What currency will we use? These questions keep circling in my mind as I contemplate our rapidly advancing future.
The path of academic progress seems clear, but if it becomes too disruptive, we risk heading down a dangerous path. As we advance, we must consider what these changes mean for society as a whole. Perhaps the key lies in finding balance – embracing progress while preserving what makes us human.</p>
