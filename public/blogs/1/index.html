                <h3 id="welcome-to-my-journey-in-academia">Welcome to My Journey in Academia</h3>
<p>Programming has been a significant part of my life for the past 15 years. From simulating the Sun to modeling plants, I’ve explored various aspects of the world around us through numerical methods. Looking back, it’s been a journey filled with challenges, discoveries, and growth.</p>
<p>In this blog, I want to share my programming journey and academic experiences—not as a polished narrative, but as a candid recollection of what comes to mind. Right now, programming skills are how I earn my bread and butter. Reflecting on where I started, what I learned, and the moments where I stumbled, I hope to capture the essence of my path so far.</p>
<p>This is my first blog post on my website, and it’s more about revisiting the milestones that brought me here. I’ll write, reflect, and edit iteratively as I go—just like coding, where nothing is perfect on the first run.</p>
<h3 id="2006--2010">2006- 2010</h3>
<p>My programming journey began with the very first program I wrote. Over the past 15 years, I’ve spent most of my time programming and simulating different things that make up  a part of this world from Sun to Plants, I have simulated different aspects of it only using some numerical methods. But after all this time and work, when I try to recall my earliest days in coding, only bits and pieces come back to me. We can’t remember everything, can we? What I do remember, I wanted to share here in my very first blog on my website.</p>
<p>During my bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication engineering (around 2007 to 2010) at BMSIT, Bengaluru, I remember writing sorting algorithms in C++ and working on microcontroller programming in assembly language. I was working with MATLAB, where I only remember implementing high-pass, low-pass, and band-pass filters. These stand out as strong memories, even though there were countless other programming exercises (maybe I have a weak memory) across various subjects.</p>
<p>So, don’t think I was very interested in programming. During this time, I actually thought programming was an technically inferior as compared to designing physical circuits, antennas, or other electronic devices. But eventually, it became a part of my career. Till now, I have survived with it. And so, I will share more of my stories, like my master’s and PhD, down the line. But I just wanted to clarify that I was not at all passionate about programming in the beginning, and I don’t even claim that I’ve achieved something big, like inventing a new programming language. What I am trying to say is, right now, I am very comfortably earning my bread and butter with programming. That’s why I thought of writing this blog.</p>
<h3 id="my-masters-saga-in-usa-2010-2014">My Masters Saga in USA (2010-2014)</h3>
<p>So, it was in 2010 when I finished my bachelor’s degree. All I wanted was to pursue higher studies in a good country. And of course, the obvious choice—even now—is the United States. It attracts a lot of people, and during my time, I also went to the United States to do my master’s degree. In 2010, I joined the University of Alabama in Huntsville to study electrical engineering.</p>
<p>Back then, the fees were high for a middle-class Indian family, just like they are today. To make it work, my parents had to part with almost 50% of their life savings. So, once I got to the U.S., I had to figure out ways to save or make money while studying. One obvious way was to get a graduate research assistantship or a teaching assistantship.</p>
<p>However, coming from India with poor English language skills, it was tough. My GRE verbal score wasn’t great (330/800), though I scored very high in quantitative (780/800)—90th percentile, which means I did better than 90% of the test-takers. But even with that, my weak English made it harder to secure a teaching assistantship.</p>
<p>In those days, we didn’t have ChatGPT or tools to help us improve our English, like the way it’s helping me write this blog now in 2025. So, my options were limited. I didn’t have the privilege or luck in this life of attending elite universities like Stanford or MIT, where students could study on scholarships and explore anything they wanted. But now in 2025, it does not matter for me, you know we get old and mature and we see life differently, isn’t it. But in my master’s degree, my only choice was to be honest, work hard, and finish the master’s degree.</p>
<p>Opportunities were scarce, and only a few professors had funding. I ended up choosing a Late Prof. Nagendra Singh as my Master’s thesis adviser who was working in computational plasma physics employing methods like particle in cell and Magnetohydrodynamics ( a kind of CFD), even though it was very new to me. Prior to this, I had no idea what a plasma is, except in my high school I heard it as 4th state of matter and it was present in Sun. So I took on a thesis under him because it offered a graduate research assistantship that reduced my fees and expenses. This was the first time I was pushed into the world of computing and modelling because my job required me to learn Linux, supercomputing, and other tools. And so, out of necessity—to save money and complete my master’s degree—I was introduced to super computing and PHYSICS. This was the first time I encountered Linux, which, surprisingly, wasn’t part of my undergraduate curriculum in India. It seems Linux is only taught in computer science programs, but I feel it should be introduced across all branches of engineering.</p>
<p>Back then, around 2010-2011, Stack Overflow and online forums were my best friends. Google was like the GPT of that era for me. Those were the days I learned about command-line interfaces, running jobs on supercomputing clusters, and the concept of software licenses. Until then, I had taken software like MATLAB for granted. In my undergraduate days, I used it on university computers without considering who paid for it. But during my master’s, when I needed it for home assignments, I discovered that I need to pay for a student edition and a company makes this software called Mathworks. You know, the process called learning! I also had to learn about parallel computing, learning about MPI and OpenMPI for messy fortran codes.  Python wasn’t as mainstream as it is today, so I worked primarily with MATLAB and Fortran.</p>
<p>So, let me also share what exactly was my work during my master’s degree. There was this 2,000-line Fortran code my professor gave me, and honestly, it was the first time I realized that a code could even exceed 2,000 lines! Back in my bachelor’s, whether it was a band-pass filter or a Fourier transform, most of our lab exercises were 50 lines of code at most. This was on a completely different level.</p>
<p>The task was to modify this massive code because it didn’t compute the magnetic field of a Helmholtz coil. My professor asked me to write a function for that, solve it numerically using the Biot-Savart law, integrate it, and then parallelize it using MPI. The goal was to model how plasma flows in an experimental device and compare the results with actual experiments conducted at the Australian National University.</p>
<p>First, I wrote a code to solve the Biot-Savart law. It wasn’t overly complex, but handling it in 3D added its own challenges. Then, I integrated this new functionality into the existing Fortran code, ensuring that the variables and logic aligned perfectly. It was like adding a new feature to a large, unfamiliar system. Somehow, I managed to finish this work in six months. Looking back, I wonder if it was the energy of youth or sheer necessity that pushed me through. It wasn’t easy, but it resulted in two publications.</p>
<p>If you ask me now whether this work made a significant impact, I’d say probably not. I feel that even if I had taken a non-thesis option or chosen a different field, it wouldn’t have mattered much in the long run. But at that time, getting published felt like winning a Nobel Prize. Seeing my name on a paper gave me immense pride. Those publications, which you’ll still find on my CV, form the basis of my contributions to the physics of plasma.</p>
<p>While working on this project, I developed a deep love for physics. It felt almost spiritual to me, and I began regretting my decision to pursue engineering instead of physics. This newfound passion drove me to apply for a PhD in physics. However, switching to a good university wasn’t easy. Navigating the application process in a foreign country was unclear to me, and I didn’t have strong recommendations.</p>
<p>In the same town, there was another university—a historically black university with many Indian faculty members. To satisfy my love for physics, I joined their PhD program. But the work there felt far from what I imagined physics would be. It mostly involved lab experiments, like working with biophysics and optics, which didn’t align with my interests. I was handling polymer molecules, thin membranes, and chemicals like polybutadiene, often without proper safety measures. The fumes caused skin irritation, and I felt more like a lab assistant than a physicist.</p>
<p>I had this romanticized idea that studying physics would take me back to the times of Newton or Gauss. But real physics, at least in the PhD program I was in, felt mundane and uninspiring. After spending one and a half years there, I decided not to waste more time. I converted my PhD into a master’s degree and returned to India.</p>
<p>I came back with no solid plan, but one thing was clear—I wanted to pursue a PhD in a reputed university, ideally ranked in the top 200. My obsession with rankings started during my master’s thesis when I had to compare my results with those from the Australian National University. That was when I realized that there exists something known as university ranking. Well if you ask me now, if ranking matter to me, I say a big NO! You know, as we age, do does wisdom!</p>
<h3 id="how-i-landed-up-first-time-in-germany-in-2015">How I landed up first time in Germany in 2015?</h3>
<p>In 2014, after leaving my PhD program, I returned to India and faced my first real spell of unemployment. That period was a turning point. I spent time earning certificates, enhancing my LinkedIn profile, and trying to build visibility through platforms like MATLAB File Exchange. Despite the uncertainty, I remained determined to pursue a PhD. I was also fascinated by the idea of studying in Europe. Many of the great physicists I admired were from European institutions, and Germany especially stood out to me. I eventually received an opportunity at the University of Paderborn for a PhD program in theoretical physics in the year 2015.</p>
<p>I should also explain why I like Germany somewhat—even now, I think it’s a great country to study. If I had to go back, I would have chosen Germany to study my masters degree.  If I look back at my experience with degrees from the US or other countries, they all required things like letters of recommendation, medical tests, and other formalities.</p>
<p>I’m originally from India, and getting a US visa itself was a struggle. I received a pink slip (221g) [you see I still remember somethings] during the process, and it wasn’t easy at all. On top of that, the fees for studying in the US were extremely high. When I went to Belgium for my PhD, they required a medical test to ensure I was disease-free before I could even begin. Although I did complete my PhD in Belgium, the visa process wasn’t that easy as I had with Germany. I do have experience getting visa from Gulf countries and they do require medical tests etc just like Belgium. Though I did not have any disease, I like Germany not caring about foreigners health when issuing visa.</p>
<p>Germany did not complicate things with me. They did not care whether I had letters of recommendation or if I had any disease for the visa. They liked my profile based on my interview and gave me admission to their PhD program in Theoretical Physics at Paderborn to which I’m still grateful. This was in the year 2015. It was in quantum physics, which fascinated me, but the level of background knowledge required was far beyond what I had. I didn’t have a strong foundation in theoretical physics, and after one year, I had to quit the program. Unfortunately, by then, I had become somewhat of an expert in quitting PhD programs.</p>
<p>Despite leaving the program, it was an incredible experience. I learned a lot, but I had to accept my limitations in theoretical physics. I knew I still wanted to complete a PhD, so I kept looking for opportunities. That’s when I received an offer from the University of Louvain in Belgium to work on modelling the electrical signatures of plant roots. The project intrigued me because it involved modelling, and I’ve always liked plants. At first, I thought, “What does the electrical signature of plants even mean?” But the idea sounded interesting, so I applied. To my surprise I got this job offer in 2016.</p>
<p>At that time, I reached out to my professors from my two master’s degree universities in the US, but they didn’t respond to my requests for recommendation letters. Germany had been the only country where I didn’t need recommendation letters, and they had given me a chance based purely on my profile. Thankfully, the professors from the University of Paderborn, despite my quitting their program, were kind enough to provide me with recommendation letters. Those letters helped me secure the PhD fellowship in Belgium, and that’s where I eventually completed my PhD.</p>
