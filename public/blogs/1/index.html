                <h3 id="welcome-to-my-journey-in-academia">Welcome to My Journey in Academia</h3>
<p>Programming has been a significant part of my academic life for the past 15 years.
From simulating the Sun to modeling plants, I’ve explored various aspects of the
world around us through numerical methods. Looking back, it’s been a journey filled
with challenges, discoveries, and growth.</p>
<p>In this blog, I want to share my programming journey and academic experiences—not as
a polished narrative, but as a candid recollection of what comes to mind. Right now,
programming skills are how I earn my bread and butter. Reflecting on where I started,
what I learned, and the moments where I stumbled, I hope to capture the essence of my path so far.</p>
<p>This is my first blog post on my website, and it’s more about revisiting the
milestones that brought me here. I’ll write, reflect, and edit iteratively as
I go—just like coding, where nothing is perfect on the first run.</p>
<h3 id="2006--2010">2006- 2010</h3>
<p>My programming journey began with the very first program I wrote. Over the past 15 years,
I’ve spent most of my time programming and simulating different things that make up  a part of this world
using some numerical methods. But after all this time and
work, when I try to recall my earliest days in coding, only bits and pieces come back to me. We can’t remember everything,
can we? What I do remember, I wanted to share here in my very first blog on my website.</p>
<p>During my bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication engineering <strong>(around 2007 to 2010)</strong>
at BMSIT, Bengaluru, I remember writing sorting algorithms in C++ and working on microcontroller
programming in assembly language. I was working with MATLAB, where I only remember implementing
high-pass, low-pass, and band-pass filters. These stand out as strong memories, even though there
were countless other programming exercises (maybe I have a weak memory) across various subjects.</p>
<p>So, don’t think I was very interested in programming. During this time, I actually thought
programming was an technically inferior as compared to designing physical circuits, antennas,
or other electronic devices. But eventually, it became a part of my career. Till now, I have
survived with it. And so, I will share more of my stories, like my master’s and PhD, down the line.
But I just wanted to clarify that I was not at all passionate about programming in the beginning,
and I don’t even claim that I’ve achieved something big, like inventing a new programming language.
What I am trying to say is, right now, I am very comfortably earning my bread and butter with programming.
That’s why I thought of writing this blog.</p>
<h3 id="my-masters-saga-in-usa-2010-2014">My Masters Saga in USA (2010-2014)</h3>
<p>So, it was in 2010 when I finished my bachelor’s degree. All I wanted was to pursue higher studies in
a good country. And of course, the obvious choice—even now—is the United States. It attracts a lot of people,
and during my time, I also went to the United States to do my master’s degree. In 2010, I joined
the University of Alabama in Huntsville to study electrical engineering.</p>
<p>Back then, the fees were high for a middle-class Indian family, just like they are today. To make
it work, my parents had to part with almost 50% of their life savings. So, once I got to the U.S.,
I had to figure out ways to save or make money while studying. One obvious way was to get a graduate
research assistantship or a teaching assistantship.</p>
<p>However, coming from India with poor English language skills, it was tough. My GRE verbal score
wasn’t great (330/800), though I scored very high in quantitative (780/800)—90th percentile,
which means I did better than 90% of the test-takers. But even with that, my weak English made it harder
to secure a teaching assistantship.</p>
<p>In those days, we didn’t have ChatGPT or tools to help us improve our English, like the way it’s
helping me write this blog now in 2025. So, my options were limited. I didn’t have the privilege or
luck in this life of attending elite universities like Stanford or MIT, where students could study on
scholarships and explore anything they wanted. But now in 2025, it does not matter for me, you know
we get old and mature and we see life differently, isn’t it. But in my master’s degree, my only choice
was to be honest, work hard, and finish the master’s degree.</p>
<p>Opportunities were scarce, and only a few professors had funding. I ended up choosing Late Prof. Nagendra Singh as
my Master’s thesis adviser who was working in computational plasma physics employing methods like particle in cell
and Magnetohydrodynamics ( a kind of CFD), even though it was very new to me. Prior to this, I had no idea what a
plasma is, except in my high school I heard it as 4th state of matter and it was present in Sun. So I took on a thesis
under him because it offered a graduate research assistantship that reduced my fees and expenses. This was the first
time I was pushed into the world of computing and modelling because my job required me to learn Linux, supercomputing,
and other tools. And so, out of necessity—to save money and complete my master’s degree—I was introduced to super computing
and PHYSICS. This was the first time I encountered Linux, which, surprisingly, wasn’t part of my undergraduate curriculum in India.
It seems Linux is only taught in computer science programs, but I feel it should be introduced across all branches of engineering.</p>
<p>Back then, around 2010-2011, Stack Overflow and online forums were my best friends. Google was like the GPT of that
era for me. Those were the days I learned about command-line interfaces, running jobs on supercomputing clusters, and
the concept of software licenses. Until then, I had taken software like MATLAB for granted. In my undergraduate days,
I used it on university computers without considering who paid for it. But during my master’s, when I needed it for home
assignments, I discovered that I need to pay for a student edition and a company makes this software called Mathworks.
You know, the process called learning! I also had to learn about parallel computing, learning about MPI and OpenMPI for
messy fortran codes.  Python wasn’t as mainstream as it is today, so I worked primarily with MATLAB and Fortran.</p>
<p>So, let me also share what exactly was my work during my master’s degree. There was this 2,000-line Fortran code
my professor gave me, and honestly, it was the first time I realized that a code could even exceed 2,000 lines!
Back in my bachelor’s, whether it was a band-pass filter or a Fourier transform, most of our lab exercises were
50 lines of code at most. This was on a completely different level.</p>
<p>The task was to modify this massive code because it didn’t compute the magnetic field of a Helmholtz coil.
My professor asked me to write a function for that, solve it numerically using the Biot-Savart law, integrate it,
and then parallelize it using MPI. The goal was to model how plasma flows in an experimental device and compare the
results with actual experiments conducted at the Australian National University.</p>
<p>First, I wrote a code to solve the Biot-Savart law. It wasn’t overly complex, but handling it in 3D added its own challenges.
Then, I integrated this new functionality into the existing Fortran code, ensuring that the variables and logic aligned perfectly.
It was like adding a new feature to a large, unfamiliar system. Somehow, I managed to finish this work in six months.
Looking back, I wonder if it was the energy of youth or sheer necessity that pushed me through. It wasn’t easy, but it
resulted in two publications.</p>
<p>If you ask me now whether this work made a significant impact, I’d say probably not. I feel that even if I had taken
a non-thesis option or chosen a different field, it wouldn’t have mattered much in the long run. But at that time,
getting published felt like winning a Nobel Prize. Seeing my name on a paper gave me immense pride. Those publications,
which you’ll still find on my CV, form the basis of my contributions to the physics of plasma.</p>
<p>While working on this project, I developed a deep love for physics. It felt almost spiritual to me, and I began
regretting my decision to pursue engineering instead of physics. This newfound passion drove me to apply for a PhD in physics.
However, switching to a good university wasn’t easy. Navigating the application process in a foreign country was unclear to me,
and I didn’t have strong recommendations.</p>
<p>In the same town, there was another university—a historically black university with many Indian faculty members.
To satisfy my love for physics, I joined their PhD program. But the work there felt far from what I imagined physics
would be. It mostly involved lab experiments, like working with biophysics and optics, which didn’t align with my interests.
I was handling polymer molecules, thin membranes, and chemicals like polybutadiene, often without proper safety measures.
The fumes caused skin irritation, and I felt more like a lab assistant than a physicist.</p>
<p>I had this romanticized idea that studying physics would take me back to the times of Newton or Gauss. But real physics,
at least in the PhD program I was in, felt mundane and uninspiring. After spending one and a half years there, I decided
not to waste more time. I converted my PhD into a master’s degree and returned to India.</p>
<p>I came back with no solid plan, but one thing was clear—I wanted to pursue a PhD in a reputed university, ideally
ranked in the top 200. My obsession with rankings started during my master’s thesis when I had to compare my results
with those from the Australian National University. That was when I realized that there exists something known as
university ranking. Well if you ask me now, if ranking matter to me, I say a big <span style="color: red;">NO!</span>
You know, as we age, so does wisdom!</p>
<h3 id="how-i-landed-up-first-time-in-germany-in-2015">How I landed up first time in Germany in 2015?</h3>
<p>In 2014, after leaving my PhD program, I returned to India and faced my first real spell of unemployment. That period was a
turning point. I spent time earning certificates, enhancing my LinkedIn profile, and trying to build visibility through
platforms like MATLAB File Exchange. Despite the uncertainty, I remained determined to pursue a PhD. I was also fascinated
by the idea of studying in Europe. Many of the great physicists I admired were from European institutions, and Germany
especially stood out to me. I eventually received an opportunity at the University of Paderborn for a PhD program in
theoretical physics in the year 2015.</p>
<p>I should also explain why I like Germany somewhat—even now, I think it’s a great country to study. If I had to go back,
I would have chosen Germany to study my masters degree.  If I look back at my experience with degrees from the US or other
countries, they all required things like letters of recommendation, medical tests, and other formalities.</p>
<p>I’m originally from India, and getting a US visa itself was a struggle. I received a pink slip (221g) [I still
remember somethings!] during the process, and it wasn’t easy at all. On top of that, the fees for studying in the US were
extremely high. When I went to Belgium for my PhD, they required a medical test to ensure I was disease-free before I could
even begin. Although I did complete my PhD in Belgium, the visa process wasn’t that easy as I had with Germany. I do have
experience getting visa from Gulf countries and they do require medical tests etc just like Belgium. Though I did not have
any disease, I like Germany not caring about foreigners health when issuing visa.</p>
<p>Germany did not complicate things with me. They did not care whether I had letters of recommendation or if I had any disease
for the visa. They liked my profile based on my interview and gave me admission to their PhD program in Theoretical Physics
at Paderborn to which I’m still grateful. This was in the year 2015. It was in quantum physics, which fascinated me, but
the level of background knowledge required was far beyond what I had. I didn’t have a strong foundation in theoretical
physics, and after one year, I had to quit the program. Unfortunately, by then, I had become somewhat of an expert in
quitting PhD programs. I even tried to get into PhD programs in India, I did not succeed, I will keep that to a different blog,
so dont think, I did not keep India as an option. For me, European universities felt much more easier to work with.</p>
<p>So coming back, despite leaving the PhD program at Paderborn, it was an overall a experience. I learned a lot including (Bitte, Danke),
but I had to accept my limitations in theoretical physics. I knew I still wanted to complete a PhD somewhere, so I kept looking
for opportunities. That’s when I received an offer from the University of Louvain in Belgium to work on <strong>modelling the electrical
signatures of plant roots</strong>. The project intrigued me because it involved modelling, and I’ve always liked plants. At first,
I thought, <span style="color: red;">“What does the electrical signature of plants even mean?”</span> But the idea sounded
interesting, so I applied. To my surprise I got this job offer in 2016.</p>
<h3 id="my-struggles-with-letters-of-recommendations-in-2016">My Struggles with Letters of recommendations in 2016</h3>
<p>At that time, I reached out to professors from the two universities where I had completed my master’s degrees in the US.
However, getting recommendation letters proved to be a challenge.
From the second university, where I had quit their PhD program after working as a lab assistant,
the Indian professors at this University weren’t happy with my departure, and I wasn’t comfortable
asking them for a recommendation letter either. Still, it is a requirement for most PhD programs. So I asked and got no
response. Some people do not care beyond their own projects. Its not their job whether you go homeless or beg!
Since then I try to avoid working with such people.</p>
<p>At the first masters university, where I had stellar publication record, my main advisor for the plasma physics thesis
had unfortunately passed away by then—he was already in his 70s at the time I worked with him. I hadn’t networked with many
other professors during my master’s, so I didn’t have anyone else to ask.</p>
<p>This whole experience made me question the necessity of recommendation letters in academia. Why do many universities
still insist on three or four recommendation letters? Do they assume supervisors are flawless judges of potential, or
do they just need a way to filter applications? To me, it seems outdated and inefficient. If a professor reviewing
applications is experienced enough, they should be able to assess a candidate based on their work and an interview—not
what other professors have to say about them.</p>
<p>I really dislike this system. If I ever become a professor, I wouldn’t take recommendation letters seriously.
Of course, some professors give great recommendations, but why should it be a requirement? It’s a waste of time
for the professors who write them, and it feels like a relic of the past. I hope that before I die, this academic
system changes for the better.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the professors at the University of Paderborn in Germany, despite my quitting their program and not asking me a
recommendation letter in the first place, were kind enough to provide me with <strong>recommendation letters</strong> for the Belgian PhD.
But its rare you see, had they refused, maybe I would not have completed a PhD. Those letters ultimately helped me secure the
PhD fellowship in Belgium, where I finally completed my PhD. My PhD adviser even once said, my supervisor from Paderborn
(where I quit within one year) gave him a very good recommendation!</p>
<h3 id="my-phd-2016-to-2020-in-belgium">My PhD (2016 to 2020) in Belgium</h3>
<p>So, I got my Belgian visa and began my PhD at the <strong>University of Louvain</strong>. If you ask me what stands out from those years of research,
it’s this: I learned how to create finite element meshes for very complicated geometry. Before my PhD, I was proficient in the finite
difference method, but finite element methods were new territory for me.</p>
<p>In my earlier experiences—whether during my master’s or at the University of Paderborn in theoretical physics—coding always
involved starting from scratch. I had to write everything myself. But during my PhD, I learned how to utilize ready-made software
models developed from years of multiple PhD projects like EIDORS (tomography in MATLAB) or R-SWMS ( plant modelling tool in Fortran).
Whether it was for electrical resistivity tomography (EIDORS) or simulating plant roots (R-SWMS), the challenge was to use these tools
in a synchronized way to solve my specific problem.</p>
<p>The specific problem I worked on during my PhD wasn’t something I defined myself. My professors had proposed the problem, secured
funding for it, and I accepted the offer to work on it. The project was focused on quantifying the electrical signature of plant
roots.</p>
<p>In a way, this is how the academic system works at least in Europe—it’s like an industry. A project exists, funding is secured,
and researchers are brought in to help solve the problem and complete the project. That’s how most PhDs work in Europe. Unlike in
places like IITs or IISc in India or some elite rich universities like Yale or Harvard, where students often spend the first couple
of years figuring out what they want to do, the PhD structure in Europe is more defined from the start.</p>
<p>The PhD problem was well-defined, which meant I could focus my energy on solving it without wandering aimlessly. Having such a
structured PhD also gave me time to pursue other interests. For example, during my PhD, I finally learned to play the violin—something
I had wanted to do for years but never had the time to even buy one. I wouldn’t call myself an expert now either, but I learned for
about a year. At least in this lifetime, I had the chance to play a violin, and that was possible because my PhD project saved me time
by being so focused.</p>
<p>In my opinion, professors are experienced enough to propose meaningful problems, and if they believe a problem is worth solving, it
likely is. Our role, then, is to contribute to solving that problem, finish the project, and earn the degree. This doesn’t mean you
lack independence in a well-defined project. These projects often operate within a larger framework, giving you the freedom to explore
related ideas.</p>
<p>For instance, within my PhD’s broader framework of quantifying the electrical signature of roots, I worked on a smaller project to
show that electrical anisotropy could be used as a root phenotyping parameter. While this idea was presented at conferences, it never got published. But that didn’t matter much to me at the time because it was an opportunity to explore something new within the boundaries of the larger project.</p>
<p>It’s a misconception that well-defined projects restrict creativity. In fact, I believe they’re better because they save time and
allow for focused progress. When I look back now, at 35 as I am writing this blog, I truly understand the value of time. Anything
that helps save time should be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Now coming back to the PhD work, If I had to pick my most significant contribution during my PhD, it would be developing
finite element meshes in 3D for complex plant root systems. This was no small feat and was appreciated by my peers. Apart from
that, my PhD work led to two first-author publications, with 80% of the paper writing being my own contribution, and the rest
polished by my thesis supervisor.</p>
<p>This felt different from my master’s degree, where I also had three publications (two as the first author and one as the second).
However, during my master’s, my writing was significantly revised by my thesis supervisor—more than 50% of it. Back then, I might
have been generating results and figures, but I wasn’t structuring the papers myself. It felt like I was a precursor to ChatGPT
for my advisor, where I provided inputs, and they assembled the work into a coherent paper.</p>
<p>This experience gave me a broader perspective on the “number game” in academia. While some places, like in developing world, still
value publication numbers above all else, I believe it’s the quality and originality of the contribution that matter more. But
that’s a discussion for another blog.</p>
<p>Returning to my PhD, I worked extensively on simulating plant root water uptake. One of my tasks involved adapting a finite
element software originally designed for medical imaging of heart and lung systems. This tool, developed in the UK, was repurposed
for our experiments with maize root systems in a risotron setup. Creating finite element meshes for these complex geometries was
challenging but rewarding.</p>
<p>Once I completed meshing a single root system, I scaled up my work. I automated tasks to simulate thousands of plants and their
interactions. Automation was a significant skill I developed during my PhD. Before this, I would run one software, manually plot
each result, and feel content. But during my PhD, I had to scale up these processes. By my fourth year, a single plant simulation
that used to feel monumental had become just a DOT in a scatterplot of thousands of simulations.</p>
<p>This was also the time—around 2018—when I was introduced to Python. Although Python had been around for a while, it was new to me.
I quickly grew fond of it and transitioned away from my old buddy MATLAB. From then on, Python became my primary tool for simulations
and data processing.</p>
<p>In 2020, I defended my PhD thesis. This was during the COVID-19 pandemic, a time that brought its own set of challenges.
When I defended my PhD in October 2020, the world had changed—it was the time of COVID. It was the first time I experienced
lockdowns, restrictions, and the chaos of a pandemic. People were dying everywhere, and the world felt like a war zone.
Somehow, I managed to finish my PhD and return to India during this turbulent time. Looking back, it was surreal,
almost like living through a world war. But we made it through, and life moved on.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>I think I’ll end this blog here. If there’s anything to take away from my journey, here’s what I’d advise:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to change paths</strong>. I started in electronics, ventured into plasma physics, attempted theoretical physics, and
finally finished my PhD in a mix of electrical engineering and plant modelling. Your first choice doesn&rsquo;t have to be your final
destination.</li>
<li><strong>University rankings aren&rsquo;t everything.</strong> While I was once obsessed with university rankings, I&rsquo;ve learned that what matters more
is finding the right fit for your goals and circumstances. Some of my most valuable experiences came from unexpected places.
For example, it was only after completing my PhD, during the COVID time when I was unemployed, that I learned about the existence
of the stock market and the massive financial world it represents. I discovered that there are companies like BlackRock or Morgan
Stanley handling trillions of dollars in transactions. It was eye-opening to realize how much of the world operates through these
financial systems—something I had never thought about during my academic journey.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to code</strong>, regardless of your field. Even though I initially thought programming was technically inferior to hardware design,
it became my bread and butter. Being adaptable with technology opens doors. Even now I see how difficult it is to find a job without
this skill. Though we have LLM&rsquo;s now, it would take atleast a decade to turn coding skills as floppy disk.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace structured opportunities</strong>. While the romantic notion of complete academic freedom is appealing, well-defined projects
(like my Belgian PhD) can actually provide focus while still allowing room for creativity and side interests.</li>
<li><strong>Build relationships</strong> respectfully. The professors at Paderborn provided recommendations even after I left their program,
which proved crucial for my future. How you leave matters as much as how you start.</li>
<li><strong>Time is precious.</strong> Looking back at 35, I realize the value of time more than ever. Choose structured programs and opportunities
that respect your time while allowing you to grow both professionally and personally.</li>
