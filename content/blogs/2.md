### 2125: The Two Minds Future

I occasionally fast-forward to see where AI might go as it grows smarter and can compete with humans in today's tasks. These CEOs and Gen Z business owners frequently claim to work 120–140 hours per week, or at the very least, support it for their staff members (I'm not sure if it's possible to work 140 hours per week and maintain mental health). This is especially true outside of Europe, where work-life balance is well-known. In an academic setting, a typical project in my field of study, like building a functional digital twin for an agricultural test field, can take well over two years with teamwork and other administrative duties. This is because our work is frequently limited by human limitations, and AI may help us accomplish these objectives much more quickly. Even with AI, creating a digital twin of an agricultural field could take longer than two years. This isn't because it's technically impossible to complete in two weeks, but rather because, in academia, fewer workers are typically hired for a given task, and these workers also have lives outside of work and many other responsibilities that AI can't replace or help with anytime soon (kids, hobbies, the ups and downs of everyday life).

Let's now imagine that all 8 billion people are driven to put in those absurd 140 hours of work, whether they are coding, gathering data, creating AI systems, operating buses or trains, etc. All of this human labor, whether it be direct AI or code development or physical labor creating training data for a physical robot, would be expedited at an astounding rate. The final outcome? Superintelligent artificial intelligence, automated driving systems, and armies of robots are likely to arrive much sooner than anticipated. No one will want to spend any more time in front of a computer to code or operate a vehicle thanks to this incredibly intelligent AI. We don't even need to sit in front of a computer or gaze at a smartphone to access this super intelligence.We'll most likely have something much more straightforward instead: a digital twin, or even better, an AI mind that becomes a part of us. 


Social media today already has a big influence on people's thoughts, both positively and negatively, and it takes up a lot of time from all of humanity. In a century, our smartphones will have AI minds that can think like two different people. The way our brains connect to this AI mind is similar to how gadgets connect to Wi-Fi. Artificial general intelligence and brain interfaces are already making some headway.
All of this development will organically combine to create a second mind that can interact with our brain. These speculative AI minds might also alter or develop our biological minds to deal with not just the body and the minds of other people, but also a second AI mind that is more intelligent than all of humanity combined. 

I will also be able to switch between my biological and AI minds with this mental configuration. I will never be able to tell when someone is responding with their AI mind while their actual mind is elsewhere. We might even be able to purchase various AI mind versions, perhaps at varying price points! 
For some of us, our bodies may be controlled by an AI mind while our minds have been transferred to a robot.

The intriguing thing is that, thanks to LLMs and whatever else we create, this AI mind would have access to all knowledge. The AI mind would continuously teach our biological brain new things. We are continuously learning from our own AI mind; traditional schools and teachers are no longer necessary. 
Additionally, the AI mind would be learning from the evolution and thought processes of our biological mind. They would operate in unison. You could even switch between your physical digital twin and your biological body once they are in harmony like that.

Therefore, we would have AI doctors who could fix any "mind bugs"—for example, if your AI mind disconnects or you are unable to connect to it correctly. Your body's vitals would be continuously monitored by the AI mind, which would be so detailed that it could detect cancer in as few as 100 cells. This would be the technological equivalent of those yogis or enlightened individuals who claim to be able to sense each organ functioning through chakra activation. These are just a few of the options available to us!

While pursuing my master's degree at Alabama in 2014, I saw the Johnny Depp film Transcendence; however, it was a complete failure. 
Perhaps in 2125, everyone will have a mind that never dies, just like in that film. I believe that the issues they faced in that 2014 film won't exist in a century. I mean, this movie didn't inspire me to write this blog, but it suddenly came to me while I was writing it. In fact, it was one of my favorite films at the time.

Let's assume that this technology is flawless and not evil like it was in the film. Everything is fine; I'm sitting there with this AI mind (not just mine, but 2125's chatGPT), robots brewing my coffee, and everything else (if I live to see that day, I won't). Then what? What's the goal? Perhaps I would end up enjoying farming, watering plants, or simply doing manual labor. We'd be going full circle, you know, taking in the rain, sunshine, and nature! Prior to the industrial revolution, people did just that. Perhaps AI eliminates the complexity that we have created. However, there is a huge risk: what if it doesn't function as planned? If someone hacks your laptop, that's one thing, but what if they hack your mind? It's frightening.

However, what use would it serve humanity even if everything went according to plan? Indeed, spiritual values, physical labor, and enjoying nature all existed before the invention of modern technology. Perhaps the most advanced technology will end human suffering from illnesses and other conditions. However, for healthy individuals? They may even turn around completely. However, this technology would be fantastic for those with disabilities, such as those who are blind or deaf. Just looking at it from the standpoint of a healthy, normal person, perhaps we will once more find joy in the small things. Who knows, maybe coding on a laptop will seem as archaic as going to the beach one day. 

In 2025, artificial intelligence will have the ability to access all human knowledge through a chat window, impacting an economy worth trillions of dollars. By 2125, each of us may have a digital twin of our own, with which we can have endless conversations. What sort of economic structure will manage that? What kind of money are we going to use? Indeed, we can see the direction of science, but if it advances too quickly, we may find ourselves in a potentially hazardous situation. We must consider the implications of all of this for everyone as we move forward. 
Perhaps it all comes down to striking the ideal balance between too much and too little.

Why are we eight billion people here if all these digital twins are powered by nuclear power plants and all physical labor is done by robots? We're putting all of our effort into creating this ideal AI world right now, but after it's finished... what will happen? With this crazy, cutting-edge technology operating in the background, we might wind up exactly where we started. Isn't it fascinating to consider? Thus, I will conclude this blog post here.
