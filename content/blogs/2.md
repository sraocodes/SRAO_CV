### 2125: The Two Minds Future

As AI becomes increasingly intelligent, I often find myself fast-forwarding to imagine where this interesting trajectory leads us. We often see these CEOs and Gen Z 
entrepreneurs putting in like 120-140 hours per week or at least advocating it for their employees (I'm not sure if they're really doing it). As a postdoc, a typical 
work on creating digital twins for an agricultural field can take well over two years with collaborations and other administrative tasks, because our work is often tied 
to our human limitations. For example, building something like a digital twin of an agri field might take more than two years â€“ not because it's technically impossible, 
but because we actually have lives outside work and most are still employees! Employees have got families, kids, hobbies, and all these other things that make us living 
organisms on this earth shaped by nature or the grand universal order.

Now imagine if we pushed all 8 billion people to work those crazy 140 hours - everyone coding, collecting data, building AI systems. All this human effort, whether 
it's physical work generating training data for robot or direct AI development, would get fast-forwarded at an incredible pace. The end result? We'd probably end up 
with superintelligent AI and armies of robots way sooner than expected. But here's the thing - in 100 years, nobody's will want to sit in front of a computer to 
access this super-AI. Instead, we'll probably have something way more direct - a digital twin, or better yet, a second mind, an AI mind that becomes part of us. 
That's what all this intense work is leading to - not just better computers, but literally a second mind to deal with!

Right now social media are already messing with people's minds, eating up their time, especially kids. But at least you can put down your phone or shut your laptop, 
right? But imagine this future where we've got these AI minds. Think of it like how devices connect to Wi-Fi, except it's our brains connecting directly to this AI mind. 
And that's where things get really interesting - and maybe scary. What happens when we're always connected to this second mind? Who actually controls these AI minds? Who 
has access to them? It could totally change our biological minds and society in ways we can't even imagine - both good and bad. It's like social media's effects on steroids,
 but now it's literally part of our consciousness.

And with this mind setup, you'll be able to switch between your biological mind and AI mind. When I talk to someone, I'll never know if they're using their AI mind 
to respond while their real mind is somewhere else. We could even get different versions of AI minds - maybe shopping for ones that come at different prices! 
Some of us might have our mind migrated to a robot while our body runs on the AI mind.

The interesting thing is, this AI mind would have access to all knowledge through LLMs and whatever else we develop. But here's what's wild - your biological brain
would be constantly learning from the AI mind. No more traditional schools or teachers needed - you're just constantly learning from your AI mind. And check this out 
- the AI mind would also be learning from how your biological mind development and how it thinks. See what I mean? They'd work in perfect sync. Once they're in harmony 
like that, you could even move between your biological body and a physical digital twin.

Then we'd have AI doctors that could fix any "mind bugs" - like if your AI mind goes offline or you can't connect to it properly. The AI mind would always be monitoring 
your body's vitals, so detailed it could spot cancer when it's just 100 cells. It's kind of like those yogis or enlightened people who say they can sense each organ working 
through chakra activation - except this would be the technological version. These are the amazing possibilities we'd have!

Here's where it gets interesting - you know, there was this movie I watched back in 2014 while doing my master's at Alabama - Transcendence. Yeah, that's the one! Like in that 
movie, maybe everyone will have a mind that never dies, but with bugs of course. I think in 100 years, we won't have the same problems they had in that movie from 2014. I mean,
 I didn't get inspired by this movie, but as I'm writing this, it just popped into my mind? It was actually one of the movies I really enjoyed back then.

So let's say we have this technology working perfectly, not sinister like in the movie. Everything's good, I'm sitting there with this AI mind, robots making my coffee and 
everything (if I survive to see that day). But then what? What's the purpose? Maybe I'd end up enjoying just doing physical work, farming, or watering plants. You know, 
enjoying nature, sunshine, rain - we'd be going in one full circle! That's exactly what ancient people used to do. Maybe we created all this complexity, and now AI takes 
that complexity away. But there's this enormous risk - what if it doesn't work as intended? I mean, it's one thing if someone hacks your laptop, but what if they hack your 
mind? That's scary.

But even if everything goes perfectly, what's the human relevance then? Sure, we'll have spiritual values, physical work, enjoying nature - all this existed before 
technology anyway. Maybe ultimate technology will remove human suffering like diseases and stuff. But for healthy people? They might just go back full circle. Though 
for people with challenges, like those without legs or vision, this technology would be amazing! I'm just thinking from a normal, healthy person's perspective - 
maybe we'll end up enjoying the simple things again. Who knows, maybe someday coding on a laptop will feel as outdated as enjoying a day at the beach. 

Here we are in 2025 with AI that can tap into all human knowledge through a chat window affecting trillion worth economy. By 2125, we might each have our own digital 
twin, just endless conversations with our AI digital twin. What kind of economic system's will handle that? What currency will we even use? Sure, we can see where the 
science is headed, but if it moves too fast, we could end up somewhere pretty dangerous. As we push forward, we've got to think about what all this means for everyone. 
Maybe it's all about finding that sweet spot - not too much, not too little.

I mean, think about it - if we've got nuclear plants powering all these digital twins, and robots doing all the physical work, what are we 8 billion humans even here 
for? We're using all our energy right now to build this perfect AI world, but once it's done... then what? Maybe we'll end up right back where we started, but with this 
crazy advanced tech running in the background. It's wild to think about, right?
