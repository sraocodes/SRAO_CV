          As a capstone for my Bachelor of Engineering degree, I undertook a project that involved the development of a prototype for a vehicular robot. The primary objective was to ensure collision avoidance using advanced electronic components and programming methodologies. 
          
          **Key Achievements and Tasks:**
          - Development and integration of the 8051 microcontroller, which was programmed using Assembly language and HDL Verilog.
          - Hands-on design and assembly of the circuit, which required meticulous soldering techniques to ensure the system's durability and functionality.
          - Active collaboration with my project partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/praveenranganath/" target="_blank">Praveen</a>, fostering an environment of teamwork.
          - Successful demonstration of the prototype in real-world scenarios.

            I undertook a significant role in simulating particle-in-cell dynamics of a plasma thruster during my tenure as a research assistant at the University of Alabama. Under the guidance of Professor Nagendra Singh, I delved deep into several technical aspects of plasma dynamics and thruster simulation. The following highlights capture the essence of my work and contributions:
            - **Key Achievements and Tasks:**
              * Developed and optimized FORTRAN codes tailored for the simulation.
              * Implemented advanced algorithms to solve Poisson's equations.
              * Innovatively tracked particle movements in self-generated electrostatic fields.
              * Conducted a comprehensive study on the formation of electric double layers in helicon plasma devices.
              * Leveraged the capabilities of the Alabama Supercomputer for high-performance computing tasks, ensuring accurate and timely simulation results.
              * Designed and executed MATLAB scripts, enhancing data visualization and processing of extensive simulation datasets.
            - **Publication:** Our research findings were prominently acknowledged and were published in the prestigious <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-abstract/19/9/093507/910187/Numerical-simulation-of-current-free-double-layers" target="_blank">Physics of Plasmas</a> journal in 2012.
