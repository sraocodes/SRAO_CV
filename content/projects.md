            During this period, I was deeply involved in a project centered on electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulation with a focus on Alfvén wave. The core aim was to decipher the Alfvén wave structures, a pivotal phenomenon with applications in understanding solar dynamics.
            
            Employing two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, our project delved into the turbulence generated from small-scale dispersive Alfvén and electrostatic waves, driven by a large-scale standing shear Alfvén wave (LS-SAW). This standing wave, set up by reflecting a propagating LS-SAW, resulted in significant plasma density modifications. 

            The ponderomotive force and drifts from this wave led to non-thermal features in the plasma. Intriguingly, parametric instabilities combined with these features birthed both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, giving rise to a broad frequency spectrum. This spectrum showcased peaks at specific perpendicular wave numbers, suggesting a non-local parametric decay.

            A significant observation was the ratio of the perpendicular electric to magnetic field amplitude in a standing-wave supported density cavity. Our findings showed potential alignment with characteristics observed from satellite data in space plasmas.

            **Key Achievements and Tasks:**
              * Utilized particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the turbulence arising from Alfvén waves.
              * Identified and analyzed the role of the ponderomotive force in creating density modifications.
              * Unearthed a broad frequency spectrum characterized by distinct wave numbers, hinting at non-local parametric decay.
              * Drew potential parallels between our turbulence features and satellite observations in space plasmas.
              * **Publication:** Our research was acknowledged and published in the prestigious <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-abstract/19/12/122303/282602/Plasma-turbulence-driven-by-transversely-large" target="_blank">Physics of Plasmas</a> journal.

          Collaborating with Late Prof. Nagendra Singh at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, I utilized the electrostatic particle-in-cell code from my earlier projects to delve into the fascinating phenomena of electrostatic waves in a helicon plasma device. 

          Experimental measurements showcased a distinct conical structure in the plasma density within the plasma plume of the helicon device. This study revealed the generation of primarily ion Bernstein modes in high-density regions. Our findings particularly emphasized the impact of plasma waves generated by radial ion beams on the overall plasma plume structure, resulting in magnetic field-aligned striations near the conical density surface.
