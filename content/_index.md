intro_text: |
  Welcome! I'm Dr. Sathyanarayan Rao, a computational scientist and research associate at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru.  
  My work bridges scientific software development, machine learning, and high-performance computing with applications in hydrology, digital agriculture, and complex systems.  

  Through my PhD (UCLouvain, Belgium) and international research experiences in Germany, Belgium, and the USA, I've developed a strong background in computational modeling, data-driven simulation, time-series analysis, and digital twin development. At IISc, I apply these skills to integrate remote sensing, machine learning, and field data to better understand soilâ€“waterâ€“crop interactions.  

  Beyond research, I actively engage in technical communication and education**, running the YouTube channel named Compute Stories, where I explain computational science, data analysis, and modeling concepts in simple, accessible ways.  

  On this site, youâ€™ll find my research highlights, technical projects, and reflections on computational approaches in science and engineering. Feel free to explore and connect with me through the platforms below!
