subtitle: "Computational Scientist | Researcher | Creator | Explorer of Ideas & Worlds"
intro_text: |
  Computational scientist at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. I bridge scientific software, machine learning, and high-performance computing with applications in hydrology, digital agriculture, and complex systems.

  My work spans computational modeling, data-driven simulation, and digital twin development—integrating remote sensing, ML, and field data to understand soil–water–crop interactions.

  I also run Compute Stories on YouTube, making computational science accessible to everyone.
