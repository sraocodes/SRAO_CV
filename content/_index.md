  Welcome! I'm Dr. Sathyanarayan Rao, a scientific software developer passionate about bridging computational engineering and Machine Learning/ AI. Through my doctoral research on dynamic root water uptake modeling and subsequent work, I've developed expertise in scientific modeling, machine learning, inverse problems and data assimilation techniques.

  My journey spans multiple continents and institutions, contributing to my unique perspective on computational approaches in physical sciences. Currently, at Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich, I'm advancing the Digital Agricultural Avatar project, where we're revolutionizing our understanding of plant-soil interactions through advanced computational modeling.

  On this site, you'll find my research contributions, technical projects, and insights from my research interests. Feel free to explore my online presence through these platforms:
